# MuJoCo_ROS RRBot Example

## Prerequisites

- MuJoCo (tested with 2.2.0 - 2.3.2)
- MuJoCo python bindings (`pip install mujoco` and make sure the bindings match the MuJoCo version!)

## Installing

1. Create catkin workspace (`mkdir -p mj_ros_demo_ws/src && cd mj_ros_demo_ws && catkin init`)
2. Clone the demo repository into the workspace with `git clone https://github.com/ubi-agni/mujoco_ros_demos src/mujoco_ros_demos`
3. Download ros package dependencies into catkin workspace src folder with `vcs import > src/mujoco_ros_demos/rrbot_example/rrbot.deps src`
4. Build catkin workspace with `catkin b rrbot_mujoco` and source the devel space
5. Run `roslaunch rrbot_mujoco rrbot_launch use_sim_time:=true`

by streaming to the joint position controller command topics (check the boxes in the spawned rqt window for a sine signal) the two joints of the robot can be controlled.

### rrbot\_launch
Set `use_urdf2mjcf:=true` to generate the MuJoCo xml directly from the URDF with [urdf2mjcf](https://github.com/balandbal/urdf2mjcf).
Set `rviz:=true` to start an rviz visualization.

# Explanation

To use a robot model in both MuJoCo and ROS (rviz, ROS Control, ...) we need both the original URDF model, which is used by the ROS ecosystem and (as long as MuJoCo is not able to sufficiently handle URDF) a MuJoCo xml model, that is as consistent with the URDF as possible.

The `rrbot_description` package contains a `urdf` subdirectory where the original xacro files that generate the URDF are located. The xml subdirectory contains the port to mujoco which also uses xacro.

> **Warning**
> Whenever you use xacro to generate a MuJoCo xml model, keep in mind, that MuJoCo is unable to handle the root tag that is always generated by xacro. We use a bash script which pipes the xacro output into `head` and `tail` commands to remove the tags that are not interpretable by MuJoCo.
