# Simulation of Tactile Sensors

You can choose to either simulate our [barometric](./baro_5x5) sensor in a scene recreated from a real world environment mentioned in our IROS 2023 workshop paper `More Accurate Tactile Sensor Simulation with Hydroelastic Contacts in MuJoCo`

Or play around with some objects falling on a Myrmex sensor: [myrmex](./myrmex) 

More examples will be added in the future!
